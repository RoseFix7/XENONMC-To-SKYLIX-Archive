**What is Oxide?** Oxide is a full-stack framework that allows you to create both front-end and back-end! Oxide supports native UI components, cross-platform desktop, cross-platform mobile, and the web! There is much more to Oxide such as server side API programming, but this into just scratches the surface of this framework.

**Why Should You Use Oxide?** Oxide suggests productivity! We have worked hard to create a framework that is consistent, easy-to-use, and has a warm welcoming community!
